1. Code Review

- The UI is not mobile-responsive.
- Poor accessibility
- Use of innerHTML can cause a potential security risk
- Use button tag instead of anchor tag when handling click event only
- Error handling is missing when server doesn't work

2. Accessibility

- Buttons do not have an accessible name
- Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
- Alt Text for Images are missing
- Keyboard Input Accessibility(TabIndex is missing) is missing
